\maketitle
\section{Describe how you processed your data and what features you used. Your exploratory analysis
here should motivate the model you use in the next section.}
\section{Describe your model. Explain and justify your decision to use the model you proposed. How
will you optimize it? Did you run into any issues due to scalability, overfitting, etc.? What
other models did you consider for comparison? What were your unsuccessful attempts along
the way? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the different models being compared?}
\section{Describe your results and conclusions. How well does your model perform compared to
alternatives, and what is the significance of the results? Which feature representations worked
well and which do not? What is the interpretation of your modelâ€™s parameters? Why did the
proposed model succeed why others failed (or if it failed, why did it fail)?}
